Implemented and tested level 1 ,2 and 3 but still struggling with the test of the log.
The object of the log class is named log and the hash function in that class is also log. I am having problem in accessing the hash function as I need all the data. It shows an error whenever i use @log.log and I am still trying to figure it out.
Implemented and tested the last two levels. Everything except show all is working. All the commands verified and tested and I also checked all the .txt files to confirm whether the save function was working or not
