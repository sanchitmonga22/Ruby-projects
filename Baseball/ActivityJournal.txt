Queries 1 through 10:
Estimated Time	01 00
Plan:To follow the instructions and select the required data.
(Order of implementation, testing approach, etc.)

Complete
Actual Time	01 40
Observations:At first it was difficult to understand the material. I think the types of operations are not clearly mentioned in the ppts. So i had to look up on the web and learn. It took me longer than expected just becuase i was not familiar with the language. But once I finished the first 3 queries it became easier for me to understand.
